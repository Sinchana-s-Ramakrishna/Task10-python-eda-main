# Task 10 – Python EDA & Outlier Detection

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Students Performance dataset.

## Steps Performed
- Loaded dataset using pandas
- Checked shape, info, and summary statistics
- Identified missing values
- Visualized distributions using histograms and boxplots
- Detected outliers using IQR method
- Capped outliers to reduce skewness
- Generated correlation heatmap
- Exported cleaned dataset

## Files Included
- task10_eda.ipynb – Complete analysis notebook
- cleaned_dataset.csv – Dataset after outlier handling
- eda_findings.txt – Summary of insights
